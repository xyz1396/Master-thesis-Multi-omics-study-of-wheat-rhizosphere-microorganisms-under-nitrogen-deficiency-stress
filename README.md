  - Abstract
    
      - Wheat is an important grain crop in China, and nitrogen is an
        essential nutrient element for the growth and development of
        wheat. However, the utilization efficiency of nitrogen
        fertilizer applied in the field is very low. The loss of
        nitrogen fertilizer is driven by soil microorganisms, and the
        input of nitrogen fertilizer is also one of the main driving
        forces for the change of soil microbial community structure. In
        addition, plants directly obtain mineral nutrients from the
        rhizosphere environment, and enzymes secreted by rhizosphere
        microorganisms can catalyze the decomposition of complex organic
        matters in the soil into simple inorganic substances for
        utilization by plants. Rhizosphere microorganisms are essential
        to the healthy growth of plants. We set up an root chamber
        experiment of wheat with different distances from root to bulk
        soil and different nitrogen input. We combined the traditional
        plant and soil physio-biochemistry experimental methods and soil
        multi-omics methods of genomics, proteomics to study how the
        wheat rhizosphere microorganisms change under nitrogen
        deficiency stress. In detail, we tentatively explored the
        species, genes and proteins‚Äô abundance change. The conclusion is
        as follows. Under nitrogen deficiency stress, the diversity of
        microorganisms in wheat rhizosphere increased significantly, and
        Œ± microbial diversity in wheat rhizosphere soil was
        significantly lower than that in bulk soil. Nitrogen deficiency
        stress and rhizosphere effect had significant effects on the
        microbial community structure in the root box soil of wheat.
        There was a significant positive correlation between the
        abundance of nitrospirae and the nitrate nitrogen content in
        soil. At class level, 12 kinds of wheat rhizosphere
        microorganisms at different classification levels enriched under
        nitrogen deficiency stress, and 6 kinds enriched under urea
        input treatment. Under nitrogen deficiency stress, the
        interaction network of microorganisms in the rhizosphere soil of
        wheat had higher average connection degree and lower
        modularization degree. Nitrogen deficiency induced mRNA
        synthesis, glycolysis, peroxides metabolism and phosphoinositol
        metabolism of microorganisms in wheat root box soil. There were
        fewer detected genes under nitrogen deficiency stress than under
        urea input treatment, and the abundance of 7 KEGG annotations at
        the second classification level was significantly lower under
        nitrogen deficiency stress. The abundance of COG functional gene
        annotation in 1 category was significantly higher under nitrogen
        deficiency stress, and that in 8 categories was significantly
        lower under nitrogen deficiency stress. Protein of wheat
        rhizosphere microbes with high abundance were mainly from
        AlphaproteobacteriaÔºåGammaproteobacteriaÔºåActinobacteriaÔºåBetaproteobacteriaÔºåAcidobacteriaÔºåDeltaproteobacteriaÔºåChloroflexiÔºåPlanctomycetesÔºåCyanobacteriaÔºåGemmatimonadetes.
        Proteins from respectively from 13 and 14 genera could only be
        detected under the stress of nitrogen deficiency of microbes and
        urea input treatment. GO annotations about biological processes
        of proteins with significantly different abundance between
        samples under nitrogen deficiency stress and samples treated
        with urea input were mainly related to organic substrate
        metabolism, metabolism of nitrogenous compounds, and response to
        environmental pressure or stimulation. Nitrogen deficiency
        stress caused significant changes in microbial diversity,
        community structure, abundance of functional genes and abundance
        of functional proteins in wheat rhizosphere soil. In the wheat
        rhizosphere soil under nitrogen deficiency stress, some
        microbial groups were significantly enriched, and the gene
        abundance and protein expression levels related to energy
        metabolism, nitrogen compound metabolism and stress
        significantly changed. This study provides the insight for the
        nutrient element cycling process in the rhizosphere of wheat,
        broadens the scale of the study on the response of
        microorganisms in the wheat rhizosphere under nitrogen
        deficiency stress, and provides some theoretical basis for the
        production practice of increasing fertilizer use efficiency. The
        functional microorganisms and functional proteins identified in
        this study can lay the basis for the culture of wheat
        rhizosphere probiotics and the cloning and heterologous
        expression of functional genes. Besides, we explored the methods
        of soil protein extraction, proteomic mass spectrum
        identification and the subsequent biological information
        analysis process, which can also provide reliable technical
        guidance for soil metaproteomics studies in the future.

      - Abstract: „ÄêObjective„ÄëRhizosphere microorganisms play an
        essential role in the process of nutrient absorption of crops.
        To improve the nitrogen utilization efficiency in wheat
        production, it has great significance to study the effects of
        nitrogen deficiency on the microbial community structure in the
        rhizosphere of wheat. „ÄêMethod„ÄëThe experiments on rhizobox
        planted with wheat were treated with different nitrogen
        application using typical Lou soil in Guanzhong region, Shaanxi
        province, and 16S rDNA amplicon high-throughput sequencing was
        used to analyze the soil microbial diversity and community
        structure. „ÄêResult„ÄëThe content of soluble inorganic nitrogen in
        the soil played a leading role in the change of microbial
        community diversity and community structure. Compared with
        regular nitrogen supply, soil microbial community has higher Œ±
        diversity index under nitrogen deficiency. The abundance of
        Nitrospirae is positively correlated with the content of nitrate
        in the soil. Under nitrogen deficiency, Micrococcales were
        enriched in the rhizosphere soil. Bacilli and Thermoleophilia
        were enriched in the near rhizosphere. The average degree of the
        co-occurrence network was significantly higher, and the
        modularity was lower under nitrogen deficiency and in the
        rhizosphere soil than that under regular nitrogen application
        level and in non-rhizosphere soil, respectively.
        Nitrososphaeria, a kind of AOA, was a critical node of the
        co-occurrence network affected by nitrogen deficiency.
        Nitrosospira had the most significant effect on the accuracy of
        random forest classifier, and it can be used as a biomarker for
        the prediction of nitrogen fertilizer application. Nitrogen
        deficiency induced the metabolic processes, such as mRNA
        synthesis, glycolysis, and peroxides, and phosphoinositol
        metabolism, which might be a benefit for stress resistance of
        microorganisms. „ÄêConclusion„ÄëThe results indicated that nitrogen
        deficiency and rhizosphere effect significantly affected the
        diversity, community structure, and metabolic function of the
        rhizosphere microorganisms of wheat. It is helpful for the
        exploration of plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria and provides
        some theoretical basis for improving the utilization efficiency
        of nitrogen fertilizer in wheat
production.
